# Welcome to My Moving Box Realtime
my first group project carried out by two of us.

## Task
TODO - What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
Complete an index.html file with the missing javascript code in order to move the "div" without changing the html file.
## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?
We did research on box movements and setting intervals to animate the div and came up with a solution.
## Installation
TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
It was made to animate automatically based on the instruction of the project.
./my_project argument1 argument2
```

### The Core Team
I worked with Zaphania_s for the project.
